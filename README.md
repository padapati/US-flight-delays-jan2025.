 ✈️ US Flight Delays Dashboard – Tableau Analysis (January 2025)

This project is an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes flight delays across U.S. airports using FAA flight data from January 2025. The goal is to uncover patterns in delays, identify top-contributing airports, and understand the reasons behind delayed flights.

 Objective
This project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing U.S. flight delays using real-time aviation performance data from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for January 2025. The objective is to identify which airports experienced the most delays, examine the leading causes of these delays, and compare actual delays to predicted metrics — helping uncover patterns and performance gaps across the national airspace system.

Tools & Data
Python: Used for initial data exploration and cleaning.
Excel: Used for manual inspection, preprocessing, and light transformations.
Tableau: Primary tool for visual analytics and dashboard development.
Dataset:
Real-world flight delay data sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation, covering January 2025 arrival delays across major U.S. airports.

Process
Data Acquisition
Downloaded publicly available on-time performance data for January 2025 from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Removed nulls and irrelevant columns
Renamed headers for clarity
Filtered dataset to only include arrival delays by airport
Data Exploration (Python & Excel)
Calculated total delays and categorized delay types (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security, Late Aircraft)
Computed additional metrics like cancellation rate and actual vs predicted delay
Visualization in Tableau
Created a series of visualizations including:
A U.S. map showing delay hotspots by airport
A bar chart breaking down delay types
A treemap comparing predicted vs. actual delays
Additional visual insights like top airports by total delay

Conclusion

This project revealed meaningful insights into the causes and patterns of flight delays across major U.S. airports during January 2025. A few key takeaways include:
I identified the airports most responsible for delays, pointing to where operational improvements could have the greatest impact.
Carrier-related and weather delays were the most common, particularly at major hub airports.
By comparing actual delays with predicted metrics, I was able to highlight gaps in airline performance and punctuality.
The interactive Tableau dashboard I built allows users to explore these trends in a dynamic way, offering practical insights for airlines, airport authorities, and travelers alike.
Overall, this analysis shows the value of using data to drive better decisions in air traffic management and improve the passenger experience.
